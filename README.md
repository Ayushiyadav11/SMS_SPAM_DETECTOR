## SMS Spam Classifier

This project is a Machine Learning model that classifies SMS messages as either Spam or Ham (Not Spam). It applies Natural Language Processing (NLP) for text preprocessing and uses Naïve Bayes algorithms to achieve reliable classification.

## Key Highlights

Cleaned and preprocessed SMS dataset (tokenization, stopword removal, stemming)

Extracted text features using Bag of Words and TF-IDF Vectorization

Trained and compared Multinomial, Gaussian, and Bernoulli Naïve Bayes classifiers

Evaluated performance using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score & Confusion Matrix

Visualized dataset insights and model performance with Matplotlib & Seaborn

## Tech Stack

Language: Python

Libraries: pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Techniques: NLP, Feature Extraction, Naïve Bayes

## Results

Achieved up to 98% accuracy on test data

Provides a lightweight and fast solution for spam detection

## Use Cases

Detecting spam SMS messages in mobile apps

Extending to email spam filtering

Fraud detection in secure messaging platforms
